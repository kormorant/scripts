# scripts
Scripts I wrote for various reasons and might need the day after I delete them, so I won't.

## pingsweep.sh
This script asks you for an IP address and subnet, and will commence to ping all possible addresses in that subnet and let you know if the address responds. I wrote this during my training for the Linux+ certification.

## gameoflife.py
A crappy implementation of Conway's game of life. Prints to the commandline, generations are simply printed below each other. Not much to it.

## move-delete-downloads.sh
A script that identifies downloads that haven't been touched in a while, and moves them to a different folder. From there, if they stay untouched, they are moved again, and after that, deleted. This requires certain folders to exist (see the script itself, should be self-explanatory).
