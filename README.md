# scripts
Scripts I wrote for various reasons and might need the day after I delete them, so I won't.

## pingsweep.sh
This script asks you for an IP address and subnet, and will commence to ping all possible addresses in that subnet and let you know if the address responds. I wrote this during my training for the Linux+ certification.

## gameoflife.py
A crappy implementation of Conway's game of life. Prints to the commandline, generations are simply printed below each other. Not much to it.
